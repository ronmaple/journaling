I suddenly find myself with more time in my day. Spent about an hour to reflect, and it's now time to get back to it lol

General goals for Oct. 27 (Fri) - Nov 3 (Friday)
- Work through some basic Leetcode problems, in a scheduled time
- Brush up on React
- Others


### Oct 28, 2023 - Saturday

I normally don't try to do too much learning on weekends (I do my long runs on weekends + errands, etc), but given the circumstances, I'll do a little bit whenever possible without interrupting my personal life.
