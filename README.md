### October 27, 2023 - Friday

I suddenly find myself with more time in my day. Spent about an hour to reflect, and it's now time to get back to it lol

General goals for Oct. 27 (Fri) - Nov 3 (Friday)
- Work through some basic Leetcode problems, in a scheduled time
- Brush up on React
- Others


### Oct 28, 2023 - Saturday

I normally don't try to do too much learning on weekends (I do my long runs on weekends + errands, etc), but given the circumstances, I'll do a little bit whenever possible without interrupting my personal life.


### Nov 8, 2023 - Wednesday

The job market is pretty bad, but there's nothing that I can do about that. I'm focusing on a few things:

#### Coding:
For the next few weeks or months:
Data Structures & Algos (70%), Side projects (20%), general programming videos (10%)

- I want to focus more on Leetcode (Data Structures and Algorithms), and get a decent foundation as I've never really had the chance to. I'm anticipating that the market will pick up again in 2024 Q1+. 
- Once I get a decent basis (I have a set of problems that I want to solve), I'll switch my focus to coding more side projects.
- Since I got injured, I've been on the trainer bike more, where I'll mostly loosely tune in to Tech related videos

After my set of DSA Q's, probably end of December:
- DSA - (30%), Side projects (50%), System design (20%)
  
#### Running:
I injured my right knee 2 weeks ago (which I later realized might be my IT bands) from probably too much running, but I perservered and worked up to strengthen my muscle imbalances. I'm slowly going to build up to 40km this week, 50km next, etc, all the way to my previous maintenance of ~70km+. Too bad it happened at the time that it did though, this would've been a great time to run more, but it's good that I'm recognizing it now so I can train smarter for the BMO marathon.
